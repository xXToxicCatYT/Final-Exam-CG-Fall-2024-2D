Odd: Hologram

The shaders I decided to use:

Hologram
Colour Correction (Toggle with 1)
Lambert
Glass
Wave

Hologram was used on the player so that the player could be different from all the other objects.

Hologram made the player transparent and applied some highlight to the rim.

There is a green colour correction for the game.
The colour correction was done by rendering a texture onto the screen.

Lambert was used for the background.
Lambert was achieved from normal diffuse and directional light.

Glass was used for the boundaries to make them transparent and unable to be seen as I do not want the player to see the boundaries.
The glass used transparency and texture.

Wave was used on the obstacles to give them a more prominent look. Wave was also used on the power-up to make it look more special.
Wave uses the sine function to make the objects move.
